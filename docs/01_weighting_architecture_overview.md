# Corruptibility Index (CI) — Private Internal Repository
**Version 1.0 (Internal / Confidential / Non-Public)**  
**Last Updated: December 2025**

---

## 🔒 Purpose of This Repository

This private GitHub repository contains the **canonical internal specification** for the Corruptibility Index (CI).  
It includes:

- the complete CI-Core weighting architecture  
- formulas, metrics, and normalization logic  
- temporal decay rules  
- confidence scoring system  
- AI extraction schemas and validation rules  
- governance model and versioning rules  
- regression test vectors  
- internal change log  

**This repo is the authoritative definition of CI.**  
All code, research, or implementations of CI must conform to these documents.

## 🧠 High-Level Summary of CI

The Corruptibility Index (CI) is a multi-metric, evidence-based scoring engine designed to evaluate corruption risk using:

- financial anomalies  
- donor influence  
- real-estate patterning  
- lobbying entanglements  
- transactional appointments  
- behavioral patterns  
- legal irregularities  
- investigative pressure signals  

CI produces a deterministic score from **0 to 100**, supported by:

- strict normalization  
- metric-specific formulas  
- outlier control  
- temporal decay  
- a confidence model integrating source reliability  
- reproducible AI extraction rules  

The CI-Core pipeline ensures **auditability, reproducibility, and defensibility**.

## ⚙️ How CI Works (Short Technical Overview)

The CI scoring pipeline executes in this exact order:

1. **Data Ingestion**  
2. **AI Extraction → CI Schemas**  
3. **Schema Validation**  
4. **Normalization**  
5. **Metric Raw Scoring**  
6. **Outlier Handling**  
7. **Temporal Decay Adjustment**  
8. **Confidence Adjustment**  
9. **Weighted Composite Score Calculation**  
10. **Explainability Generation**  

CI uses:

- 11 canonical weighted metrics  
- deterministic formulas  
- fixed governance rules  
- versioned changes  
- reproducible test vectors

## 🏛 Governance & Versioning

All updates must follow the rules defined in:

**11_governance_and_versioning.md**

Key principles:

- CI must be deterministic and reproducible  
- No metric may be added/removed without a **MAJOR** version bump  
- All changes must be evidence-based  
- All modifications must be logged in **13_change_log.md**  
- No changes may be made without governance sign-off  

This repository represents **CI Version 1.0.0**.

---

## 🔬 Testing & Validation

Use the test vectors in:

**12_test_vectors.md**

to validate:

- formula correctness  
- stability after changes  
- regression behavior  
- reproducibility across runs  
- confidence and temporal logic  

Any version change must pass **all** test vectors.

---

## 📜 Confidentiality

This repository contains proprietary intellectual property.  
**Do not distribute, publish, or expose any part of this content publicly.**

If a public-facing version is needed, create a **separate sanitized repository** with:

- no formulas  
- no weights  
- no internal logic  
- no schemas  
- no decay or confidence rules  
- no proprietary structures  

A public version will be generated separately.

---

## 🏁 Status

CI V1.0 is fully documented and locked.

The next steps:

- build the public-safe documentation set  
- begin controlled prototype development  
- stand up the CI website (public teaser)  
- maintain private repo integrity  

All work moves forward from this foundation.
