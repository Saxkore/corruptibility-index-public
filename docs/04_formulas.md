**Corruptibility Index (CI) – Public Scoring Method Overview**  
**High-Level, Non-Technical Explanation**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document explains, at a high level, **how the Corruptibility Index (CI) produces a score**, without disclosing any proprietary formulas, weights, or internal computation logic.

The goal is to help the public understand:

- *what* CI does  
- *how* CI approaches risk evaluation  
- *why* the method is reliable and fair  

while keeping all sensitive intellectual property confidential.

## 2. Core Principles of CI Scoring (Public Description)

The CI uses a **multi-factor scoring framework** designed to:

1. Reflect patterns widely documented in corruption-risk research  
2. Treat each individual consistently  
3. Focus strictly on **publicly available** data  
4. Prevent any single factor from disproportionately impacting the score  
5. Produce a result that is **interpretable, balanced, and stable over time**

The internal formulas are designed to ensure:

- fairness  
- transparency  
- reproducibility  
- defensibility  

These formulas are not disclosed publicly.

## 3. How CI Converts Public Information Into a Score (Conceptual)

The CI scoring process has four public-facing conceptual steps:

### **Step 1 — Organize Public Data Into Categories**  
CI sorts information into well-defined metric categories (donations, assets, networks, policy signals, etc.).  
These reflect major research areas in anti-corruption literature.

### **Step 2 — Transform Qualitative Patterns Into Quantitative Signals**  
Qualitative information (ex: investigative coverage, lobbying relationships) is standardized into comparable indicators.  
This ensures that patterns seen in different contexts can be compared fairly.

### **Step 3 — Combine Multiple Signals Into a Unified Risk Model**  
Each metric contributes to the final score.  
No single metric determines the outcome, and each is evaluated relative to its type of risk.

### **Step 4 — Produce the Final CI Score (0–100)**  
The final score represents a blended view of all observable risk patterns.  
It reflects likelihood of *structural vulnerability to corruption risk*, not guilt or wrongdoing.

## 4. Why CI Doesn’t Publish Its Formulas

Releasing internal formulas would allow:

- score gaming  
- intentional manipulation  
- reverse-engineering  
- partisan exploitation  
- data-driven misinformation  
- legal exposure due to misinterpretation  

To maintain fairness and prevent misuse, CI keeps its internal models private while publishing:

- metric descriptions  
- category explanations  
- transparency guidelines  
- example scenarios  
- responsible-use documentation  

This approach is aligned with other scoring systems such as:

- credit scoring  
- cybersecurity risk indices  
- academic influence metrics  
- compliance risk scoring systems  

which also avoid publishing proprietary models.

## 5. Conceptual Example (Safe for Public Use)

Below is a *purely conceptual* description with **no formulas**:

```
Inputs → Normalize → Compare Across Categories → Combine → Final Score
```

Conceptually:

- Inputs come from public records.  
- They are converted into consistent indicators.  
- Indicators are compared across categories.  
- CI blends them into a composite score.  

No mathematical logic is disclosed.

## 6. What the CI Score Means (Public Interpretation)

The CI score reflects:

- how closely certain public patterns resemble risk markers seen in anti-corruption research  
- the structural environment around an individual’s public activity  
- aggregated transparency and accountability signals  

It **does not** claim:

- guilt  
- intent  
- legal violations  
- certainty of misconduct  

CI is a **risk-oriented, research-informed** model.

---

## 7. Transparency Without Vulnerability

CI balances:

### **Transparency**  
Clear metric descriptions  
Public data sources  
Explainable categories  

### **Protection of the System**  
Private formulas  
Private weights  
Private model logic  

This ensures the system:

- cannot be manipulated  
- maintains fairness  
- remains stable  
- avoids misuse  

---

## 8. Public Commitments

The CI team commits to:

- publishing updates to public documents  
- providing clear explanations of metric categories  
- documenting any additions or removals of public indicators  
- maintaining a strict responsible-use policy  
- ensuring public scores remain nonpartisan and research-based
