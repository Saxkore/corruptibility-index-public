**Corruptibility Index (CI) – Public Metric Descriptions**  
**Non-technical Overview for External Audiences**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This file provides a **public-safe**, high-level overview of the metrics used by the Corruptibility Index (CI).  
It explains **what each metric represents**, **why it matters**, and **how it helps illuminate corruption risk**, without revealing:

- formulas  
- internal weighting  
- proprietary logic  
- numerical thresholds  
- implementation details  

This is appropriate for public publication, website content, press materials, and external briefings.

## 2. How CI Metrics Work (Public Explanation)

The CI uses **multiple categories of publicly documented risk indicators** grounded in:

- political science  
- economics  
- anti-corruption research  
- forensic accounting  
- investigative journalism  

Each metric reflects a *pattern* widely recognized as relevant in environments where corruption or undue influence is more likely to emerge.

No single metric determines a score by itself; CI uses **a blended, multi-factor approach**.

---

## 3. CI Metric Categories (Public Overview)

Below is a plain-language explanation of all 11 CI metrics.

---

## **M1 — Donor Influence & Funding Patterns**

This metric examines patterns in financial support such as:

- clusters of donors with aligned interests  
- unusually concentrated funding sources  
- sudden shifts in donation flows  
- relationships between donors and subsequent actions  

Research shows these patterns can reflect pathways for influence.

---

## **M2 — Wealth & Asset Growth Patterns**

This metric considers publicly observable patterns in:

- personal asset changes  
- real estate holdings  
- wealth fluctuations relative to income  
- disclosures that suggest inconsistencies  

These patterns appear frequently in corruption investigations worldwide.

---

## **M3 — Real Estate Networks & Transactions**

This metric looks at:

- complex ownership structures  
- rapid buying and selling cycles  
- use of shell companies  
- patterns often associated with concealment of interests  

Real estate is a globally documented channel for influence and hidden enrichment.

---

## **M4 — Lobbying and Outside Influence Activity**

This metric captures:

- meeting patterns  
- consultant or lobbyist overlap  
- interactions with interest groups  
- professional relationships that may affect decision-making  

Public lobbying disclosures and investigative reports form the backbone of this category.

---

## **M5 — Appointments, Contracts & Favor Exchanges**

This category considers:

- appointments following donations  
- positions given to associates or supporters  
- patterns suggesting access-for-benefit arrangements  

These signals are widely studied in political patronage systems.

---

## **M6 — Policy Misalignment Indicators**

This metric highlights cases where:

- public positions shift suddenly  
- major votes conflict with stated values  
- changes correlate with external pressures or support  

Researchers often analyze these patterns when studying influence on policymaking.

---

## **M7 — Social, Professional & Financial Network Alignment**

This metric evaluates:

- circles of associates  
- overlapping interests or business networks  
- proximity to high-risk groups or intermediaries  

Network science shows relational structures play a major role in understanding risk exposure.

---

## **M8 — Personal Conduct & Ethical Behavior Signals**

This metric includes:

- documented ethical concerns  
- repeated complaints  
- integrity-related incidents  
- patterns of behavior raising governance concerns  

It does **not** include unverified accusations.

---

## **M9 — Legal, Regulatory & Compliance History**

This category assesses:

- investigations  
- regulatory actions  
- fines or violations  
- patterns signaling oversight concerns  

These are **public record** signals, not judgments of guilt.

---

## **M10 — High-Risk Industry Associations (e.g., Gaming Licenses)**

Some industries, such as gaming, are:

- heavily regulated  
- historically associated with influence risk  
- overseen due to vulnerability to financial manipulation  

This metric reflects publicly documented risk characteristics of such industries.

---

## **M11 — Investigative, Journalistic & Watchdog Activity**

This metric captures:

- intensity of investigative reporting  
- patterns of watchdog inquiries  
- level of public scrutiny  

Higher activity often correlates with elevated public concern or visibility.

It reflects *external attention*, not an internal judgment.

---

## 4. Why CI Uses Multiple Metrics

A corruption risk assessment cannot rely on any single signal.  
Instead, CI integrates **multiple dimensions**, creating a more stable and fair evaluation.

Benefits include:

- reduces noise  
- avoids partisan interpretation  
- balances structural and behavioral factors  
- mirrors best practices in governance and compliance  
- improves interpretability and fairness  

This multi-metric structure is common in professional risk assessment systems.

---

## 5. What CI Metrics Do *Not* Do

CI metrics do **not**:

- determine guilt  
- make legal claims  
- replace investigative work  
- rely on private or leaked information  
- track personal or sensitive data  

They evaluate **patterns**, not conclusions.

---

## 6. Transparency Commitment

For public use:

- inputs are public  
- metric descriptions are public  
- explanations are public  

But:

- formulas  
- weights  
- internal models  

remain private to protect the integrity of the system.
