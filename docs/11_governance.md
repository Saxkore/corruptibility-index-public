**Corruptibility Index (CI) – Public Governance & Update Framework**  
**High-Level, Non-Technical Summary**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document explains, for the general public, **how the Corruptibility Index (CI) is governed and maintained over time**.

It describes:

- CI’s commitment to stability and fairness  
- how updates are handled  
- why versioning matters  
- what safeguards protect the system  

It does **not** disclose any internal governance mechanisms, approval workflows, change thresholds, or proprietary versioning rules.

---

## 2. CI’s Governance Philosophy

The CI is built on three key principles:

### **1. Stability**
Scores must remain consistent and reproducible over time.

### **2. Transparency (at the conceptual level)**
The public should understand what CI is, what it measures, and why it matters.

### **3. Integrity of the System**
Changes must be deliberate, evidence-based, and free from political or external influence.

These principles ensure that CI remains a **credible, trustworthy, nonpartisan tool** for analyzing patterns of public-interest risk.

---

## 3. Why Governance Matters

Because CI is a public-facing risk indicator, the integrity of the system is essential.  
Good governance ensures that:

- CI cannot be manipulated  
- updates do not introduce bias  
- public scores remain comparable across time  
- the model evolves responsibly as research advances  
- no individual or group can influence the underlying mechanics  

This approach is common in:

- credit scoring systems  
- financial risk ratings  
- regulatory compliance frameworks  
- scientific scoring methodologies  

---

## 4. Versioning (Public Explanation)

The CI uses a versioning system to clearly separate:

- **previous scoring models**  
- **current active model**  
- **future revisions**  

This allows the public to know:

- when the model was updated  
- which version produced which score  
- how the model evolves over time  

Versioning ensures **traceability** and **accountability**.

CI never retroactively alters historical results.

---

## 5. Evidence-Based Updates

Any update to CI is based on:

- new research  
- improvements in transparency practices  
- expanded public data availability  
- methodological refinements  
- advances in risk-analysis theory  

Updates are **never** based on:

- current events  
- political outcomes  
- individual public figures  
- partisan pressure  

This protects CI’s objectivity.

## 6. Categories of Public-Facing Updates

Although the internal details are private, the public can expect updates in areas such as:

### **1. Clarity and Documentation**
Better explanations, examples, and educational materials.

### **2. Expanded Transparency Resources**
Additional guides on how CI interprets public data.

### **3. Methodological Enhancements (Summary Only)**
High-level descriptions of improvements when major upgrades occur.

### **4. Research Foundations**
Adding references to new academic work that informs conceptual categories.

### **5. User-Facing Features**
Visualizations, public dashboards, or interactive risk-explainer tools.

None of these expose CI’s internal scoring formulas or logic.

---

## 7. Safeguards Against Manipulation

The CI governance framework ensures that:

- model updates follow a structured, controlled process  
- system integrity cannot be compromised by external actors  
- the scoring methodology cannot be gamed or reverse-engineered  
- scoring remains consistent across individuals and years  
- internal controls prevent unauthorized modifications  

This maintains public trust and scientific credibility.

---

## 8. How the Public Will Be Notified About Major Updates

When CI undergoes a significant update, the public-facing documentation will include:

- an explanation of the conceptual change  
- the new version number  
- a high-level summary of improvements  

Internal details remain confidential to protect the model.

---

## 9. What CI Governance Does *Not* Do

The governance system does **not**:

- adjudicate or investigate real-world cases  
- make legal or ethical judgments  
- label individuals as corrupt  
- apply subjective evaluations  
- rely on internal or private data sources  

CI governance exists solely to ensure the **integrity and fairness** of the scoring model.

---

## 10. Disclaimer

This transparency document omits all proprietary details, including:

- internal approval workflows  
- versioning rules  
- quantitative update criteria  
- audit mechanisms  
- internal checks and balances  

These appear only in the private CI-Core governance specification.
