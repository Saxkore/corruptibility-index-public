**Corruptibility Index (CI) – Public Overview of the Core Scoring Process**  
**High-Level, Non-Technical Summary**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document explains, at a **public and non-technical level**, the core process the Corruptibility Index (CI) uses to turn publicly available information into a structured risk signal.

It **does not** disclose:

- formulas  
- weights  
- internal adjustment rules  
- proprietary computation stages  
- validation logic  
- data schemas or architecture  
- any details that could enable system manipulation  

This is a transparency document for journalists, researchers, civic technologists, and the general public.

## 2. What the CI-Core Process Does

The CI-Core process is designed to:

- organize public information  
- identify patterns described in corruption-risk research  
- ensure consistent treatment of individuals  
- maintain fairness, stability, and neutrality  
- produce a single, interpretable score  

It works similarly to other risk-assessment frameworks in finance, compliance, and policymaking, but focuses strictly on **public transparency indicators**.

---

## 3. High-Level CI Pipeline (Public Version)

The internal CI-Core pipeline contains many precise steps, but publicly it can be understood through **four conceptual phases**:

### **Phase 1 — Collect Public Information**
The CI incorporates only publicly available documents such as:

- financial disclosures  
- donation databases  
- real estate filings  
- lobbying reports  
- legislative actions  
- public news coverage  
- oversight reports  

No private or confidential information is used.

---

### **Phase 2 — Organize and Standardize Information**
Public information varies widely in format and structure.

CI organizes these materials into consistent categories aligned with:

- political science research  
- anti-corruption studies  
- transparency frameworks  
- investigative journalism traditions  

This step ensures that different types of information can be compared fairly.

---

### **Phase 3 — Assess Risk Indicators Across Multiple Dimensions**
CI evaluates patterns across several broad categories such as:

- financial transparency  
- influence networks  
- public decision-making  
- asset patterns  
- oversight and accountability signals  

No single indicator determines the final score.  
Instead, CI uses a **multi-factor approach** that reflects decades of global research on corruption risk.

---

### **Phase 4 — Generate a Composite Risk Signal**
After organizing and evaluating the patterns, CI produces a final score:

- scaled from **0 to 100**  
- designed to be interpretable to the public  
- representing relative corruption-risk exposure based on public data  

This score is **not** a judgment of guilt or wrongdoing.  
It is an **aggregated transparency-risk indicator**.

---

## 4. What CI-Core *Does Not* Do

To avoid misinterpretation:

### ❌ CI does NOT use private data  
Only public information is included.

### ❌ CI does NOT determine guilt  
It highlights risk patterns, not legal judgments.

### ❌ CI does NOT use AI to score  
AI only assists with clerical organization of text.

### ❌ CI does NOT rely on subjective interpretation  
All internal processes follow deterministic rules.

### ❌ CI cannot be directly reverse-engineered  
Internal logic remains private to prevent gaming or manipulation.

## 5. How CI Ensures Fairness

CI’s core logic is designed to:

- prevent overreliance on any single data point  
- adjust for noise in public reporting  
- treat individuals with similar data patterns consistently  
- reflect changes responsibly as new public information emerges  
- avoid creating partisan or ideological bias  

The model cannot be influenced by personal judgment, opinion, or political perspective.

---

## 6. Relationship Between Public Transparency and the Final Score

The CI score reflects:

- the structure of a person’s public financial environment  
- the degree of influence or lobbying entanglement  
- the complexity of asset and network patterns  
- oversight and investigative attention  
- potential vulnerabilities in governance behavior  

It does **not** reflect:

- moral evaluation  
- criminality  
- policy positions  
- ideological alignment  

It is a **transparency and risk** metric.

---

## 7. Why CI Does Not Publish Its Internal Logic

Publishing CI-Core’s internal mechanics would:

- allow subjects to manipulate the system  
- undermine fairness  
- enable reverse engineering  
- expose sensitive intellectual property  
- diminish the reliability of scores  
- allow adversarial gaming  

Therefore, CI follows the same approach used by credit scoring agencies, regulatory risk models, and cybersecurity rating systems:  
**public transparency about principles, private protection of internal formulas.**

---

## 8. Summary

The CI-Core process:

- uses **publicly available** data  
- organizes it into research-aligned categories  
- evaluates multiple risk dimensions  
- generates a fair, stable, interpretable risk signal  
- avoids partisanship, speculation, or accusations  

This public document captures the **spirit** of CI’s methodology while protecting all proprietary implementation details.

---

## 9. Disclaimer

This document intentionally omits all proprietary:

- formulas  
- weights  
- normalizers  
- outlier controls  
- temporal logic  
- confidence scoring  
- data schemas  
- error-handling rules  
- software architecture  

These appear only in the private CI-Core repository.
