**Corruptibility Index (CI) – Public Evidence Foundations Overview**  
**High-Level, Non-Technical Summary**

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document provides a **public explanation** of the research foundations behind the Corruptibility Index (CI).

It describes the **types** of evidence used in building the CI framework without disclosing:

- proprietary calibration  
- internal tables  
- weights  
- formulas  
- private data mappings  
- numerical scoring criteria  

The goal is to show that CI is grounded in established academic and investigative literature while keeping the internal system fully protected.

---

## 2. Evidence Philosophy

CI is built on the principle that corruption risk can be understood by analyzing **patterns** that appear consistently in:

- global anti-corruption research  
- political science literature  
- forensic accounting methodologies  
- regulatory oversight frameworks  
- investigative reporting histories  

The CI does **not** claim to detect corruption.  
It identifies **risk indicators** that scholars and investigators have found relevant across many contexts.

---

## 3. Types of Evidence Used in CI’s Conceptual Framework

Below is a high-level summary of the *categories* of evidence that informed the design of the CI metric structure.

### **A. Academic Research**
Studies examining:

- influence of money in politics  
- wealth accumulation and asset transparency  
- lobbying networks and policy capture  
- patronage systems  
- conflict-of-interest dynamics  
- regulatory enforcement patterns  
- corruption typologies across countries  

These research domains help define the “what matters” portion of CI.

---

### **B. Anti-Corruption Organizations & Watchdog Methodologies**

CI’s conceptual foundations reference publicly documented insights from:

- transparency organizations  
- good-governance NGOs  
- investigative nonprofits  
- public ethics commissions  

These groups highlight structural vulnerabilities such as:

- opaque financial activity  
- unusual asset transfers  
- high-risk industries  
- conflicts between public duty and private interests  

CI adapts their **broad concerns**, not their numeric scoring systems.

---

### **C. Regulatory & Compliance Frameworks**

Many compliance models identify recurring red flags, including:

- unexplained wealth  
- concentration of donors  
- revolving-door lobbying  
- contractual favoritism  
- disclosure inconsistencies  
- related-party transactions  

These frameworks provide conceptual parallels to CI’s categories.

---

### **D. Journalistic & Investigative Reporting Traditions**

Decades of investigative reporting reveal patterns frequently associated with:

- influence networks  
- quid-pro-quo dynamics  
- real estate intermediaries  
- donor-related policy shifts  
- insider appointments  
- legal irregularities  

These patterns guide **which behaviors CI monitors conceptually**, not how the score is calculated.

---

### **E. Network Analysis & Social Science Methods**

Research in network theory illustrates how:

- influence flows through relationships  
- clusters and associations can signal exposure  
- structural proximity can reflect risk context  

This informs CI’s inclusion of social and professional ecosystem metrics.

---

## 4. How Evidence Informs CI (Public Explanation)

Public evidence shapes CI in the following ways:

### **1. Identifying Relevant Categories**
CI’s 11 metrics were chosen because they are **repeatedly shown** in research to correlate with environments where corruption risk is elevated.

### **2. Providing Pattern-Based Examples**
The evidence helps CI understand what kinds of public behaviors or structures may raise transparency concerns.

### **3. Supporting a Multi-Dimensional Approach**
Risk emerges from **clusters** of signals, not isolated events—a principle reinforced across research fields.

### **4. Ensuring Nonpartisanship**
Evidence-based systems rely on structured indicators, not political judgments.

## 5. What CI Does *Not* Reveal

To preserve system integrity, CI does **not** disclose:

- internal tables matching evidence to metrics  
- research weighting  
- calibration techniques  
- thresholds or formulas  
- evidence-to-score mappings  
- proprietary interpretations of source quality  

All of these remain in the private CI-Core documentation.

---

## 6. Why Evidence Transparency Matters

Sharing CI’s public evidence foundations:

- builds trust  
- demonstrates rigor  
- shows that CI is grounded in serious research  
- highlights the academic legitimacy of corruption-risk analysis  
- helps journalists, academics, and civic technologists understand CI’s intellectual roots  

But **without** enabling score manipulation or reverse engineering.

---

## 7. Conclusion

The CI framework reflects insights from:

- political science  
- governance studies  
- economics  
- investigative journalism  
- compliance and regulatory fields  
- network analysis  

This document summarizes the **conceptual evidence base**, not the internal implementation.

---

## 8. Disclaimer

This is a public transparency document.  
It intentionally omits all proprietary details, including:

- scoring logic  
- evidence weighting  
- metric contributions  
- thresholds  
- statistical models  
- confidence assignments  
- data processing structures  

Those components are contained only in the private CI-Core specification.
