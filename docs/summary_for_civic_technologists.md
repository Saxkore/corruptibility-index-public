**Corruptibility Index (CI) — Civic-Tech Briefing**  
**Version:** 1.0

**Status:** Public Conceptual Overview  
**Last Updated:** December 2025

## 1. Purpose of This Summary

This document introduces the **Corruptibility Index (CI)** to civic technologists — the community that builds tools, dashboards, scrapers, datasets, and civic systems around public information.

It explains:

- what CI *is* as a conceptual framework,  
- how it aligns with civic-tech goals,  
- what problems it attempts to organize,  
- how technologists might meaningfully engage with it,  
- and what ethical standards govern its use.

This document contains **no proprietary formulas or scoring logic**.  
It is a safe, public-facing explanation of the conceptual architecture.

## 2. Why CI Is Relevant to Civic Technologists

The civic-tech ecosystem has produced:

- campaign-finance scrapers,  
- lobbying databases,  
- public-record dashboards,  
- legal-case trackers,  
- public-person network maps,  
- open-data repositories,  
- investigative tooling,  
- political transparency apps.

But these tools often operate **independently**.

The Corruptibility Index provides a **unifying conceptual framework** — a way to structure and contextualize diverse public-data signals.

It offers a *schema* that civic technologists can build within or alongside.

---

## 3. What CI *Is*

CI is a **multi-metric, multi-domain conceptual architecture** for understanding corruption-risk conditions using:

- public records  
- open-data APIs  
- transparency filings  
- network relationships  
- long-term trends  
- public events  
- legally accessible public information  

It is a **framework**, not a black-box model.

Think of CI as a structured “mental model” or **data ontology** for understanding institutional integrity risk.

---

## 4. What CI *Is Not*

For civic technologists, it’s important to state what CI does **not** attempt to be:

### CI is NOT:
- predictive modeling  
- criminal detection  
- de-anonymization  
- surveillance  
- personal-data harvesting  
- a tool for accusations  
- a partisan weapon  
- a judge of character  

CI does **not** label individuals as corrupt.  
It analyzes **systems and conditions**, not guilt or wrongdoing.

---

## 5. Key Concept for Technologists: *Risk Signals, Not Accusations*

CI operates on **signal families**, similar to:

- financial risk indicators  
- governance risk frameworks  
- AML “red flags”  
- integrity drift models  
- systemic incentive analysis  

A high-risk pattern does **not** imply a high-risk person.  
This distinction protects fairness and prevents misuse.

## 6. How Civic Technologists Can Engage With CI (Safely)

### 6.1 As a conceptual data schema  
CI’s subsystem architecture can help civic technologists structure:

- data models,  
- entity graphs,  
- dashboards,  
- research prototypes.  

It is a **framework for thinking**, not a software dependency.

### 6.2 As a unifying map of public-information domains  
Many civic-tech projects focus on a single area:

- donations  
- lobbying  
- legal filings  
- ethics disclosures  
- property records  
- FOIA releases  
- media analytics  

CI shows how these domains interrelate.

### 6.3 As inspiration for open-data problem statements  
Teams can build:

- data-cleaning tools  
- API connectors  
- entity resolution tools  
- audit-trail systems  
- public dashboards  
- link-analysis prototypes  

—all without implementing any CI scoring logic.

### 6.4 As a guide for responsible coding  
CI emphasizes:

- explainability  
- fairness  
- non-prediction  
- non-accusation  
- public-source transparency  
- anti-bias controls  

These align with the values of modern civic tech.

## 7. Ethical Requirements for Civic-Tech Engagement

To protect both public figures and the integrity of civic tech:

### Civic technologists **must not**:
- imply guilt, wrongdoing, or criminal intent  
- target or harass individuals  
- use CI as evidence of corruption  
- generate “lists of corrupt people”  
- publish misleading interpretations  
- combine CI with personal/private data  

### Civic technologists **should**:
- contextualize public-record signals  
- ensure transparency about methods  
- disclose limitations  
- respect due process  
- avoid sensationalism  

These standards mirror community norms in:

- open-data ethics,  
- computational journalism,  
- civic privacy,  
- algorithmic accountability.

---

## 8. Potential Civic-Tech Applications (Conceptual Only)

CI provides inspiration for safe and meaningful projects, including:

### ✓ API indexers  
Mapping which public APIs feed which transparency domains.

### ✓ Public-record cleaning tools  
Entity resolution, deduplication, and name-consolidation libraries.

### ✓ Influence-network visualizations  
Board overlaps, lobbying relationships, donor ecosystems.

### ✓ Transparency dashboards  
Non-judgmental displays of disclosure consistency, historical trends, or structural risk conditions.

### ✓ Drift-analysis tools  
Long-term trends in wealth, policy behavior, or network centrality.

### ✓ Alerts (conceptual only)  
High-level, non-accusatory monitoring of new events in public-record systems.

These applications can be built *without replicating CI’s scoring engine*.

## 9. Alignment With Civic-Tech Values

CI aligns strongly with principles widely shared in civic tech:

- **Transparency** over secrecy  
- **Public data** over private data  
- **Explainability** over black boxes  
- **Ethical restraint** over overreach  
- **Context** over sensationalism  
- **Fairness** over partisanship  
- **Public good** over personal attacks  

This alignment ensures CI remains a responsible, trustworthy conceptual framework.

## 10. Closing Notes for Civic Technologists

The Corruptibility Index offers:

- a unifying conceptual architecture,  
- a structured way to think about public-information ecosystems,  
- a map of where transparency data lives,  
- a template for responsible civic-tech development,  
- and a foundation for future work in open governance analytics.

Civic technologists are invited to explore the framework,  
**not to implement scoring systems**,  
but to advance public transparency through ethical, thoughtful innovation.
